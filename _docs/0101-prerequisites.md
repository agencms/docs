In order to run Agencms there are a number of steps to prepare your instance.

## Agencms Portal

The Agencms User-Interface is a hosted platform and you will need to ensure you have a Tenant account and your site pre-configured.

We are currently in closed-alpha testing phase so you will need to request access through our [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/agencms/shared_invite/enQtMzY0Mzk0ODIwMTQ0LThiM2ZjZWU0MzJhN2MwZDczYTMwMzAxOWY3MTcyYjIwNTc0OWI1N2E5MTI3YjVlMTY5Y2RkYmE5MDc4OGVlMTM). You will receive a welcome email with instructions of how to set your password and access the portal.
