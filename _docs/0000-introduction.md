## Overview

Agencms is a Semi-headless CMS, not just build with, but designed **for Laravel**. The aim is to empower Laravel Developers to create Admin GUIs without the need to include and maintain countless php, html, js and css files and dependencies.

The entire Admin GUI is remote-hosted, like a headless CMS, however all functionality and data is entirely hosted and managed by you, the developer. In-fact, the hosted Agencms Admin GUI has no backend infrastructure, it is purely client side and Agencms doesn't have access to your data at all. It never touches our servers.

This allows us to constantly evolve the Admin User Interface without any need to run updates on your codebase. We all know how cumbersome it can be to run updates on dozens, or even hundrets of client websites.

No longer do you need to worry about keeping up with the latest Javascript or CSS frameworks in order to maintain multiple admin GUIs.

## Content Management System

A CMS focussing on what it is supposed to do; managing content! Unlike many other platforms out there, Agencms doesn't try to be a complete Website builder. The aim is to completely separate the content from the layout and styling in order to create more managable, maintainable, re-usable content driven websites.
